# Alzheimers Data Science Project

### This project aims to do 2 things: 
### 1. Image classification for the varying degrees of Alzheimers 1-4 
### 2. Create a predictable model using tabular data to predict whether someone has Alzheimers and their level

## To-do List

- [x] Researched and created diagram for CNN and backpropagation by learning the math behind the model
- [x] Gather MRI images from [ADNI](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/)
- [x] Code CNN with Pytorch
- [x] Tuning Hyperparameters
- [x] Learn different CNN architectures to test different models
- [ ] Learn ADAM, BCEWithLogitsLoss, and Sci-kit test metrics: roc_auc_score, accuracy_score, classification_report, recall_score, f1_score, precision_score
